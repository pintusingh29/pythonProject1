Leap Year
ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª

Write a program that returns True or False whether if a given year is a leap year.
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
- on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
- unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
